Welcome to the digital HQ of **Sandesh Kumar Gupta**. 
This isn't just a portfolio; it's a simulated secure environment designed to showcase my journey in **Cybersecurity**, **Ethical Hacking**, and **Red Teaming**.

Instead of a traditional resume, I've built a **Single Page Application (SPA)** that mimics a hacker's dashboard/terminal interface, providing an immersive experience while you browse my skills and achievements.

## Features & Highlights

This project is packed with interactive elements and a distinct "Cyberpunk" aesthetic:

- **Immersive Dashboard UI**: Dark mode, terminal-style typography, and glassmorphism effects for a premium "hacker" feel.
- **Cyber Memory Game**: A built-in mini-game to test your memory skills (and take a break from the serious stuff).
- **Knowledge Base**: "Knowledge Cards" that break down complex security concepts into bite-sized info.
- **Achievements & Certifications**: A dedicated section showcasing CTF wins, certifications, and awards.
- **Services Showcase**: Detailed list of offensive security services I offer.
- **Fully Responsive**: Built with Tailwind CSS to look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

Built with modern web technologies to ensure high performance and maintainability:

- **Angular**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
