# Sandesh Kumar Gupta - My Cybersecurity Portfolio 👨‍💻🔐

Hey there! 👋 I'm Sandesh. Welcome to my personal portfolio.

I'm a B.Tech student with a huge passion for Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, and Red Teaming. I built this site to showcase the cool stuff I've been working on, my certifications, and to just have a place that truly represents my skills.

Instead of a boring resume site, I went for a full-on "hacker dashboard" vibe. I wanted it to feel like you're actually logging into a secure system. It's built as a Single Page App (SPA) so it's super snappy.

## 🌟 Cool Features

Here's what I packed into this project:

- **Cyberpunk/Hacker Aesthetic**: Dark mode, terminal fonts, and that classic green-on-black feel (but modernized).
- **Live Threat Feed**: Added a simulated real-time threat feed on the home page. It looks pretty awesome.
- **Knowledge Cards**: Little bite-sized info cards about security concepts I find interesting.
- **Project Showcase**: A detailed look at my pentesting reports, CTF achievements, and other security projects.
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on your phone too, because I used Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ The Tech I Used

I wanted to use the latest tech for this to keep my dev skills sharp:

- **Angular**: Bleeding edge! For that fast, component-based structure.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling everything quickly without writing a million CSS files.
- **TypeScript**: Because types save lives (and debugging time).

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run It

If you want to check out the code or run it on your laptop:

1.  **Clone my repo**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skgpt254/sandesh-kumar-gupta-cybersecurity-portfolio.git
    cd sandesh-kumar-gupta-cybersecurity-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install the packages**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Fire it up**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Check it out**:
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.
